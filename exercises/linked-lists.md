# Linked Lists

 
*Taken from Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition*

**Remove Dups:** Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. 

**Return Kth to Last:** Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list  

**Delete Middle Node:** Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list given only access to that node.  
> *Example:*  
**Input:** the node c from the linked list a -> b -> c -> d -> e    
**Result:** nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a -> b -> d -> e

**Partition:** Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x
> *Example:*  
**Input:** 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]  
**Output:** 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

**Sum Lists:** You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in *reverse* order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.  
> *Example:*  
**Input:** (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 296  
**Output:** 2 -> 1 -> 9

**Palindrome:** Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
