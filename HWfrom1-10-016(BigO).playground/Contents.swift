1)
memory access = 1 pico
math operations = 3 pico
storing data = 10 pico
time to run = 200 pico

a) 241 picoseconds
b) O(n^2)
c) O(n^3)

2)
a) O(n^3), O(n^4) O(n^2)
b) O(n)
c) O(n^2 log(n))
d) O(^2)


3)
a) binary search tree
b) skip list
c) maybe you could use two queues? one for storing searches as you type, and another for the searched music

4) I don't know the answer to this. What exercise 1? The one from Linus? Wording is confusing for me...

// 7) I don't know how to answer this because I don't get question 4. There's only snippet in exercise 1?
