Question 1: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-draws

Copy and paste your code:

let n = Int(readLine()!)!

for _in 1...n {

let pairsOfSocks = readLine()!

let draws = Int(pairsOfSocks)! + 1

print(draws)
}

What is the big O runtime of your code?: O(n)

Question 2: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/handshake

Copy and paste your code:

let board = Int(readLine(stripNewline: true)!)!

for _ in 0..<board {

let n = Int(readLine()!)!

print((n*(n-1))/2)
}

What is the big O runtime of your code?: O(n^2)

Question 3: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/connecting-towns

Copy and paste your code:

let firstLine = readLine(stripNewLine: true)!
let T = Int(firstLine)!

for i in (0..<T) {
let firstTestLine = readLine(stripNewLine: true)!
let N = Int(firstTestLine)!
let secondTestLine = readLine(stripNewLine: true)!
var secondTestLine = secondTestLine.characters.split(" ")

var ans = 1
for i in (0..<N - 1){
var numberOfRoutes = Int(String(characterView))!
ans *= numberOfRoutes
ans %= 1234567
}
print(ans)
}
print()

What is the big O runtime of your code?: O(n^2)
