Question 1: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-draws

// Could you write a for loop that keeps on looping until it finds the matching pair? Use n + 1 for each iteration until you find the right pair.

var numberOfDraws = NSArray()

// n + 1 until matching pair is found
// I do not know how to solve this with code...I can sort of understand and process it just by reading the question,
// but having to put it into code, especially swift, is really hard for me

Copy and paste your code:

What is the big O runtime of your code?:

O(n) since you only need 1 for loop and you cancel the other variables out which leaves O(n)

Question 2: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/handshake

use the non-repeating formula

if there are 5 people shaking hands but only once and never repeating

1 x 2
1 x 3
1 x 4
1 x 5 
= 4 handshakes

n! / (r! * (n-r)!)


Copy and paste your code:

What is the big O runtime of your code?:
O((n^2)

Question 3: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/connecting-towns

Copy and paste your code:

I genuinely do not know the answers to these questions. Googling doesn't help because I can't find a decent solution and step by step process, and the fact that this is considered easy stresses me out like crazy... 

I'm assuming Gandalf will want to only go through each town once, so use the non-repeating combination formula: n! / (r!*(n-r)!)

What is the big O runtime of your code? 
O(n^2)
