//Question 3: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/connecting-towns
//Gandalf is travelling from Rohan to Rivendell to meet Frodo but there is no direct route from Rohan (T1) to Rivendell (Tn).
//But there are towns T2,T3,T4...Tn-1 such that there are N1 routes from Town T1 to T2, and in general, Ni routes from Ti to Ti+1 for i=1 to n-1 and 0 routes for any other Ti to Tj for j ≠ i+1
//Find the total number of routes Gandalf can take to reach Rivendell from Rohan.

//Note
//Gandalf has to pass all the towns Ti for i=1 to n-1 in numerical order to reach Tn.
//For each Ti , Ti+1 there are only Ni distinct routes Gandalf can take.

//Copy and paste your code:

func possibleRoutesBetweenTowns(townRoutes:[Int]) -> Int{ //number of towns is townRoutes.count + 1
    
    var possibleRoutes = 1
