## Instructor
Caleb

##Standards
Relate fundamental computer science principles

## Objectives
Developers will be able to:
* Understand the parameters of their independent project (Mike leads this section)
* Understand the derivation of runtime complexity from a given code segment
* Explain a scenario that would run in a given runtime (e.g O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n!) )
* Given a piece of code, identify its runtime
* Code a solution to a problem and identify the runtime of the solution
