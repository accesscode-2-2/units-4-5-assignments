### Algorithms

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) defines the word _algorithm_ as “a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed”.

And here's the definition from [_Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition_](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033844) (via [Medium](https://medium.com/@_marcos_otero/the-real-10-algorithms-that-dominate-our-world-e95fa9f16c04)):
> Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

In other words, an algorithm is a specification for a program. Algorithms operate on [data structures](#data-structures).

#### Examples

You've already seen and used some important types of algorithms in your iOS projects:

* **Sorting** an array

   ```objc
   [@[@"c", @"b", @"a"] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(caseInsensitiveCompare:)]
   // -> @[@"a", @"b", @"c"]
   ```
* **Searching** for the index of an object in an array

  ```objc
  [@[@"a", @"b", @"c"] indexOfObject:@"b"]
  // -> 1
  ```
* **Inserting** and **accessing** objects in a dictionary (using **hashing**)

  ```objc
  NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
  dict[@"key"] = @"value";
  dict[@"key"]
  // -> @"value"
  ```

### Data Structures

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), “a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used **efficiently**” (emphasis added).

Here are some common operations that data structures typically support:

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|Insert|add an element|
|Access|get an element|
|Delete|remove an element|
|Search|find a specific element|
|Sort|reorder elements|

Depending on the particular structure in question, some of these operations may not apply. For example, it does not make sense to sort a hash table.

#### Comparison Chart

Here's a rough comparison of some of the most common data structures. Note the similarities and differences, and consider how a data structure's underlying implementation might affect its performance characteristics.

|Data Structure|Fast|Slow|Other|
|---|---|---|---|
|Array|insert, access|search, delete|fixed size|
|Array (Sorted)|access, search|insert, delete|"|
|Linked List|insert, delete|search|discontiguous|
|Stack|[LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO) access|all other access||
|Queue|[FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO) access|"||
|Hash Table|insert, keyed access|search||
|Binary Tree|insert, delete, search||needs balancing|
|Graph||complex algorithms|best models real-world problems|
