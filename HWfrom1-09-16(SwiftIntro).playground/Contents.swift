// 1) I really don't know how to do this one through code so I'm going to try and explain it through writing... Been at it for like 20 minutes and I don't even know where to start

let sum = (n + 1)(n / 2)
// then have a for loop that goes through the total sum
var totalSum = 0
for i in numbers {
    totalSum += i
}
return sum - totalSum // because the missing number will always be the difference of the sum and totalSum?

// copy/paste from my other playground because we did these in class

// 2)Given a list  of size N containing numbers 1 - N (inclusive). return true if there are duplicates, false if not

// I doubt that this is even remotely correct but I think I understand it. You need to compare both arrays and have a for loop for each, going through each number and finding the smallest value. Once it does, the loop stops and it should return true(?) Not sure what it should be returning.

let arr2 = [9,20,5]
